The Assignment

Write a script that downloads election results of every municipality in every district into csv file.

At this page (https://volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps3?xjazyk=CZ), you first have to choose the district by the X key in the column Výber obce (on the right). 
So when you choose i.e. district Příbram (https://volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps32?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=2&xnumnuts=2111) you then have to choose the municipality. 
This time you choose by the number of the municipality (column číslo on the left). 
So, i.e. Dobříš (https://volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps311?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=2&xobec=540111&xvyber=2111) will have the number 540111.

Input

The script expects two inputs:

Link where the list of the municipalities is located
name of the csv file without the suffix .csv

Output
The header of the csv file should have the following: municipality code, name of location, voters in the list, distributed voting envelopes, 
valid votes, candidate parties. Each row of the csv file will then represent individual municipalities.
